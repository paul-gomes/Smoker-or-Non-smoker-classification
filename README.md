# Smoker or Non-smoker Classification

## Project Description
This project attempts to classify if an insured person is a smoker. I have used a dataset from Kaggle.com to train the model. The dataset has some limitations. It does not have very many important features that could be used for classifications. However, it is a good stating point as the dataset has less noises. I have used 3 different algorithms to see which algorithms provides better results.
 

## Goal
I attempted to classify if the insured person is a smoker using 3 different algorithms - Decission Tree, SVM classifier, and Neural Nets.
